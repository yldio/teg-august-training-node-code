## Exercise 7

# Clock Event Emitter

* Create a module named `clock` that exports an event emitter.
* This event emitter emits an event every second.
* a `tic` event, followed by a `toc` event one second later
* followed by a `tic` event one second later
* etc.
* Event payload is the current timestamp

Test it:

```
$ node main
```
